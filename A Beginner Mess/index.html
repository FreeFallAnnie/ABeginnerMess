                    <h1>A Beginner's Mess</h1>
                    <p> In links at the top of the page, you will find three artworks and a hidden layer you cannot see at first glance.
                        <p>Click on the +'s in <b>A Mess</b>.</p>
                        <p>Click on the F is... in <b>F</b>.</p>                      
                        <p>Use the slider for <b>Yellow & Red</b>.</p>

                    <p>As a beginner there is a lot of opinions floating around. Personally I have seen beginner's punished for sharing their work.
                    <p>To the point, I don't really see it on the internet... maybe Tumblr.... They seem nice.</p>
                    <p>But in general terms of social media, there is a preference for people to show the perfect. The undisputably "good" stuff. With AI up and about, the beginner artist, coder, learner - will look subpar.</p>

                    <p><i>Why should people care about sharing their imperfect work? Can't they keep it as their personal hobby?</i></p>
                    <p>True. People absolutely can...</p>
                    <p>and do.</p>
                    <p>But how much of life are we missing of people we care about? To only see the end product is to miss the entire journey. Which makes up their life.</p>
                    <p><i>Okay. But I can send messages to my friends and family, it doesn't have to be public.</i></p>
                    
                    <p>Sure you can.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Ultimately. Do what works for you. And unfortunately there is a long way to go before A Beginner's Mess is accepted.
