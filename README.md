# A Beginner Mess
As a beginner there is a lot of opinions floating around. Personally I have seen beginner's punished for sharing their work.
To the point, I don't really see it on the internet... maybe Tumblr.... They seem nice.
But in general terms of social media, there is a preference for people to show the perfect. The undisputably "good" stuff. With AI up and about, the beginner artist, coder, learner - will look subpar.
I unfortunately see there being a long way to go before A Beginner Mess is accepted.

This page and the contents are about the layers to a mess made by a beginner. They don't go neatly in a tutorial, and are non-linear af (at least for me).
As I build up my portfolio, I endeavour to find ways to share what learning looks like. It's a process. Not a destination. And capturing the process is tricky. I hope by sharing the thinking behind the work, maybe, I could help others articulate their process?
I find it helpful to be able to see the various levels in what I do anyhow.
